# Overview

This project currently implements a Collaborative Filtering–based Recommendation System using user-movie ratings.
It analyzes similarities between users with cosine similarity to suggest movies that a user has not watched yet but is likely to enjoy.

This serves as a foundational recommendation engine model which can be extended to books, music, ecommerce, and more with minimal modification.
